# Img2ascii

Simple [the 1st iteration]
This converts img[png only] to ascii 

Please look at the examples provide to see input and the output.


There is no command line functionality because I coded this up after writing 2 essasy as stress killer. so manally replace the filename var 


I will probably come back soon to add some new features and optimize it.(if I am not back by 6 months I have probably moved on)

you are free to do what ever with this code.
if you are insase by using it in a commercial app just shoot me an email before use.(I am just curios )
